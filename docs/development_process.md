# Development Process

## Step 1: Setup
I installed Python and VS Code. Then I created a folder for the project and opened it in VS Code.

## Step 2: Writing the Code
- Imported the random module
- Made the function for the game
- Added while loop for continuous guessing
- Used try-except for invalid inputs

## Step 3: Git Initialization
I used the following commands:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"

## Step 4: Uploading to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/jangra-coder/CSFCP-Assignment1-Unit-5
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

## Step 5: Commits Made
Some commits I made:
- Added main logic
- Updated input validation
- Added README
- Added docs folder
- Added screenshots folder

## Step 6: Collaboration (Optional)
If collaboration was done:
- Created branches
- Opened pull requests
- Added comments

## Conclusion
This project helped me understand how to use VS Code, Git, and GitHub along with writing a small Python program.
